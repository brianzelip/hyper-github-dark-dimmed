## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2021-06-27

ðŸš¢ ðŸŽ‰

This work changes the source of the theme data. The data now comes from one step up Primer's design system stack - instead of primitives, the source is now github-vscode-theme (which in turn pulls from primitives). github-vscode-theme was not available via npm, so I had to create github-vscode-themes npm package.

Making this change allowed me to more accurately follow VSCode's implementation of the dark dimmed theme.
